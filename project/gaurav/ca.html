<h1>Chartered Accountancy (CA)</h1>
	<div><p>
	The first course that generally comes to the mind of a commerce student as a career option is CA. CA is one of the best career options after B.Com. Unlike an MBA, students can enrol for CA right after completing high school. CA comprises three stages, namely CPT, IPCC, and CA Finals. Clearing all three stages along with an internship of 2.5 years makes you a certified chartered accountant.

The duration of this course is three years, and this course can also land you jobs in multinational companies like EY or Deloitte. You can also open your own CA firm and practice your degree thus it is one of the best courses after B.Com.
