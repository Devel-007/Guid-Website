<h1>Higher-Studies</h1>
	<div><p>One of the most popular career options after engineering is to pursue further studies. If you’re a B.Tech student, then you can prepare for the GATE exam. 

GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) is an exam that tests the comprehensive understanding of undergraduate engineering subjects. With an excellent GATE score, you can enter prestigious engineering colleges (IITs and NITs) for M.Tech. M.Tech is one of the preferred courses after engineering.

You’d get to expand your knowledge and become a more-qualified engineer. If you aren’t interested in the GATE exam, you can also prepare for JAM. You can enter academics and research in your field of engineering. It is one of the best career options after engineering. 

If higher studies are not your thing, wondering what to do after btech, and curious about digital marketing, check out MICA’s Digital marketing course which offers live projects, dedicated student mentor, case studies and more.
