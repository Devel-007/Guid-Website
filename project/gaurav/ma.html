<h1>M.A.(Masters of Arts)</h1>
	<div><p>
One of the most popular career options after BA is doing a Masters of Arts. If you’re highly interested in a particular subject you studied, this might be an excellent choice for you. Master of Arts refers to postgraduate degrees, which BA graduates can join to pursue higher studies in their preferred areas.
<b>
What you can learn in this field
<br></b>
You’ll mainly learn about your chosen subjects in more detail. MA programs are perfect for those who want to study higher and enter doctorate programs or M.Phil. MA allows you to expand your knowledge of a specific domain and get more advanced options in those sectors.

For example, you can become a historian if you do a MA in History. On the other hand, if you want to become an economist, then you can get an MA in Economics. 

An MA degree is also helpful when you want to become a teacher. These programmers make you specialized in a particular subject, so after completing them, you can become a teacher of that subject. However, you’ll need to appear for the NET/TET examination for that subject, too, if you want to teach at schools or colleges. 

Minimum Eligibility
To pursue a Masters of Arts, you only need to have a BA degree. Apart from that, different colleges have different eligibility criteria, so be sure to check it out before you apply anywhere. Almost all the major universities and colleges in India offer this program.
